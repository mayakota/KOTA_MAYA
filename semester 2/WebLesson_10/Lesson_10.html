			</header>
			<p>I was born and raised in San Diego. I attended Torrey Hills Elementary School, Carmel Valley Middle School, and am currently a senior at Torrey Pines High School. I enjoy writing and am on the school's newspaper. I plan to major in mechanical engineering this fall when I go to college. In my free time, I like to sleep, eat cookies and cake and ice cream, and watch T.V. I also like to volunteer at the local libraries and through Girl Scouts, attend conferences and peer education events related to advocating for gender equality and women's rights.</p>
