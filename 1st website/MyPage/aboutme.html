			Most tags have opening and closing tags and everything in a web object is within the opening and closing tags while everything outside the tags belongs to another object. 
			The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user of the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website and browser information. 
			The body of the site includes all of the actual site content. Site content includes paragraphs, images, audio, animations and backgrounds.
			HTML does not translate spaces, tabs and return characters onto the visible parts of the body on your site. The browser looks at all of your text in one long line of code. Tags allow you to tell the browser which text in a web document to put into paragraph form.

			Adding links to a page is done using the <a> "anchor" tag. The anchor tag allows us to link to other sites, other pages on our own site and specific places in a particular page. 
			It is possible to add links to separate parts of pages by naming your different sections and creating links to them.

			The header is a system of section titles arranged from h1 to h6 in Descending order. H1 has the biggest font size and h6 has the smallest.

	<h3><a name = "images"></a>Images</h3>

			Adjusting the size of an image involves adjusting the height attribute. The image can also be distorted by changing the height and width.
